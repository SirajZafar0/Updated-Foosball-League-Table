# Updated-Foosball-League-Table
I re-did the Foosball code that I uploaded earlier, with classes for the player and the main body. I got rid of all the arrays and instead used a list of elements from the player class for all players. I have yet to add the betting system, and I shall add that soon. Currently encountering a problem with xlrd, that i will also resolve soon.  Players send their games with points to a group chat where I add the information into a google docs form. I download the results from the table at the end of the day and run this code on it to get a ranking table, and individual stats for each player in the league. I also added a feature to be able to search for all the games that were added on a specific day, to see all the games played that day and the results of that game.
